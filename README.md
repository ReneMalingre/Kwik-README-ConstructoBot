# Professional README Generator Starter Code

## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input in order to make a user's project README.md file quicker to generate and conform to professional README.me style standards.

It takes advantage of the the Inquirer npm package, and was written in JavaScript and uses Node.js as the JavaScript runtime.

 The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
